Fix adapter to not send the competition update every time. - Need help. Need to make a Cache object somehow.
Get the authemticator working properly. - DONE.
Get the changeset validations working. - DONE.
Measurements need to fail or be purged when a competition is changed? Maybe add a competition field to the measurements table?
Triggers are not visible in dbeaver. Is this a permissions issue? Commented on closed ticket https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues/18760
Sanitize the competitor data for publishing.
Still getting key errors from the adapter when:
  - Creating a pass fail measurement.
Pass/fail radio buttons not working. - DONE.
Refactor Adpater/Serializer into a Handler.
