Fix adapter to not send the competition update every time. - Need help.
Get the authemticator working properly.
Get the changeset validations working.
Measurements need to fail or be purged when a competition is changed? Maybe add a competition field to the measurements table?
Triggers are not visible in dbeaver. Is this a permissions issue?
Still getting key errors from the adapter when:
Pass/fail radio buttons not working.
Refactor Adpater/Serializer into a Handler.
