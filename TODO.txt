  - Created new issue: https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues/35986

Fix adapter to not send the competition update every time. - Need help. Need to make a Cache object somehow.
Refactor Adpater/Serializer into a Handler.

New Functionality:
Measurements need to fail or be purged when a competition is changed? Maybe add a competition field to the measurements table?
